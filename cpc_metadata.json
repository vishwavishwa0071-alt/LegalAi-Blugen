New facts must be specially pleaded.The defendant must raise by his pleading all matters which show the suit  not  be  maintainable,  or  that  the  transaction  is  either  void  or  voidable  in  point  of  law,  and  all  such  grounds  of defence as, if not raised, would be likely to take the opposite party by surprise, or would raise issues of fact not arising out of the plaint, as, for instance, fraud, limitation, release, payment, performance, or facts showing illegality.\n\n3. Denial to be specific . -It shall not be sufficient for a defendant in his written statement to deny generally the grounds alleged by the plaintiff, but the defendant must deal specifically with each allegation of fact of which he does not admit the truth, except damages.\n\n* [3A.  Denial  by  the  defendant  in  suits  before  the  Commercial  Division  of  the  High  Court  or  the Commercial Court .- ( 1 ) Denial shall be in the manner provided in sub-rules ( 2 ), ( 3 ), ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) of this Rule.\n\n( 2 )  The  defendant  in  his  written  statement  shall  state  which  of  the  allegations  in  the  particulars  of  plaint  he denies,  which  allegations  he  is  unable  to  admit  or  deny,  but  which  he  requires  the  plaintiff  to  prove,  and  which allegations he admits.\n\n( 3 ) Where the defendant denies an allegation of fact in a plaint, he must state his reasons for doing so and if he intends to put forward a different version of events from that given by the plaintiff, he must state his own version.\n\n( 4 ) If the defendant disputes the jurisdiction of the Court he must state the reasons for doing so, and if he is able, give his own statement as to which Court ought to have jurisdiction.\n\n( 5 ) If the defendant disputes the plaintiff's valuation of the suit, he must state his reasons for doing so, and if he is able, give his own statement of the value of the suit.]\n\n1.

Evasive-denial.Where a defendant denies an allegation of fact in the plaint, he must not do so evasively,  but  answer  the  point  of  substance.  Thus,  if  it  is  alleged  that  he  received  a  certain  sum  of money, it shall not be sufficient to deny that he received that particular amount, but he must deny that he received that sum or any part thereof, or else set out how much he received. And if an allegation is made with diverse circumstances, it shall not be sufficient to deny it along with those circumstances.\n\n5.  Specific  denial .- 1 [( 1 )]  Every  allegation  of  fact  in  the  plaint,  if  not  denied  specifically  or  by necessary implication, or stated to be not admitted in the pleading of the defendant, shall be taken to be admitted except as against a person under disability:\n\nProvided that the Court may in its discretion require any fact so admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admission:\n\n*[Provided further that every allegation of fact in the plaint,  if  not  denied in  the  manner  provided under Rule 3A of this Order, shall be taken to be admitted except as against a person under disability.]\n\n2 [( 2 )  Where  the  defendant  has  not  filed  a  pleading,  it  shall  be  lawful  for  the  court  to  pronounce judgment on the basis of the facts contained in the plaint, except as against a person under a disability, but the Court may, in its discretion, require any such fact to be proved.\n\n( 3 ) In exercising its discretion under the proviso to sub-rule ( 1 ) or under sub-rule ( 2 ), the Court shall have due regard to the fact whether the defendant could have, or has, engaged a pleader.\n\n( 4 )  Whenever a judgment is pronounced under this rule, a decree shall be drawn up in accordance with such judgment and such decree shall bear the date on which the judgment was pronounced.]\n\n6.

B dies and D takes out administration to B's effects, C pays Rs, 1,000 as surety for D; then D sues C for the legacy. C cannot set-off the debt of Rs. 1,000 against the legacy, for neither C nor D fills the same character with respect to the legacy as they fill with respect to the payment of the Rs. 1,000.\n- ( b ) A dies intestate and in debt to B. C takes out administration to A's effects and B buys part of the effects from C. In a suit for the purchase-money by C against B, the latter cannot set-off the debt against the price, for C fills two different characters, one as the vendor to B, in which he sues B, and the other as representative to A.\n- ( c )  A  sues  B  on  a  bill  of  exchange.  B  alleges  that  A  has  wrongfully  neglected  to  insure  B's  goods  and  is  liable  to  him  in compensation which he claims to set-off. The amount not being ascertained cannot be set-off.\n- ( d )  A sues B on a bill of exchange for Rs. 500. B holds a judgment against A for Rs. 1,000. The two claims being both definite pecuniary demands may be set-off.\n\n1. Rule 5 renumbered as sub-rule (I) by Act 104 of 1976, s. 58 (w.e.f. 1-2-1977).\n\n2. Ins. by s. 58, ibid.

B hold a promissory note for Rs. 1,000 from A and claims to set-off that amount against any sum that A may recover in the suit. B may do so, for, as soon as A recovers, both sums are definite pecuniary demands.\n- ( f ) A and B sue C for Rs. 1,000. C cannot set-off a debt due to him by A alone.\n- ( g ) A sues B and C for Rs. 1,000. B cannot set-off a debt due to him alone by A.\n- ( h ) A owes the partnership firm of B and C Rs. 1,000.

Counter-claim to be stated.Where any defendant seeks to rely upon any ground as supporting a right of counter-claim, he shall, in his written statement, state specifically that he does so by way of counter-claim.\n\n6C. Exclusion of counter-claim.Where a defendant sets up a counter-claim and the plaintiff contends that the claim thereby raised ought not to be disposed of by way of counter-claim but in an independent suit, the plaintiff may, at any time before issues are settled in relation to the counter-claim, apply to the Court for an order that such counter-claim may be excluded, and the Court may, on the hearing of such application make such order as it thinks fit.\n\n6D. Effect of discontinuance of suit.If in any case in which the defendant sets up a counterclaim, the  suit  of  the  plaintiff  is  stayed,  discontinued  or  dismissed,  the  counter-claim  may  nevertheless  be proceeded with.\n\n6E. Default of plaintiff to reply to counter-claim.If  the  plaintiff  makes  default  in  putting  in  a reply to the counter-claim made by the defendant, the Court may pronounce judgment against the plaintiff in relation to the counter-claim made against him, or make such order in relation to the counter-claim as it thinks fit.\n\n6F. Relief to defendant where counter-claim succeeds.Where in any suit a set-off or counterclaim  is  established  as  a  defence  against  the  plaintiff's  claim  and  any  balance  is  found  due  to  the plaintiff or the defendant, as the case may be. the Court may give judgment to the party entitled to such balance.\n\n6G . Rules relating to written statement to apply.The rules relating to a written statement by a defendant shall apply to a written statement filed in answer to a counter-claim.]\n\n7.

New ground of defence.Any ground of defence which has arisen after the institution of the suit or  the  presentation  of  a  written  statement  claiming  a  set-off 1 [or  counter-claim]  may  be  raised  by  the defendant or plaintiff, as the case may be, in his written statement.\n\n1.

Procedure when party fails to present written statement called for by Court.Where any party from whom a written statement is required under rule 1 or rule 9 fails to present the same within the time permitted or fixed by the Court, as the case may be, the Court shall pronounce judgment against him, or make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit and on the pronouncement of such judgment a decree shall be drawn up:]\n\n*[Provided further that no Court shall make an order to extend the time provided under Rule 1 of this Order for filing of the written statement.]\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_", "## ORDER IX\n\n## Appearance of parties and consequence of non-appearance\n\n1.
